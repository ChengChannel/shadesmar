## Simul

Python utility that merges all the header files of Shadesmar into a single
header file.

Usage, from the git root:
```
$ python3 simul/simul.py
```

The combined header file will be generated as: `include/shadesmar.h`.

This script is not a general purpose utility, its sole purpose is to work
only on Shadesmar.
